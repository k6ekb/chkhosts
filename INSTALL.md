chkhosts Build
==============

Obtain the latest copy of chkhosts from here:

    https://github.com/k6ekb/chkhosts

Change to the directory where you have cloned/unpacked the chkhosts
source.  You'll find several directories including the "install-pkg"
sub-directory.  If you change into the "install-pkg" directory
and execute the "make" command, it will build a fresh, self-extracting
bash shell archive called "install-chkhosts.sh".  This file is all
you need to install chkhosts on a system.

The Makefile provided also has a "clean" target which will remove the
build directory and related files.
